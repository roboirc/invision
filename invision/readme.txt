Welcome to mIRC.

mIRC is a full featured Internet Relay Chat client for Windows that
can be used to communicate, share, play or work with others on IRC
networks around the world, either in multi-user group conferences
or in one-to-one private discussions.

It has a clean, practical interface that is highly configurable and
supports features such as buddy lists, file transfers, multi-server
connections, IPv6, SSL encryption, proxy support, UTF-8 display, UPnP,
customizable sounds, spoken messages, tray notifications, message
logging and more.

mIRC also has a powerful scripting language that can be used both to
automate mIRC and to create applications that perform a wide range of
functions from network communications to playing games.

If you are new to mIRC, the first few sections of the mIRC help file
will introduce you to the basic features of mIRC and IRC. They will
also guide you through the first few steps of connecting to a server,
joining a channel, and chatting.

Once you have learned how to use the basic features of mIRC and IRC,
you can move on to the more complex features, such as configuring mIRC
for your own needs or learning how to create scripts and popups.

If you ever need help, remember that you can visit the mIRC website
for help resources and guides.
